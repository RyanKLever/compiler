Who calls me? 
	EOE

What is my job? 
	pop B_sar from SAS.  pop A_sar from SAS. 
	Test that A can be tested as less than B. 
	If no error, 
	Create a new symbol table entry that represents the result of this operation.  
		The type will be true or false!
	Create a new SAR that contains
		token - newly created one to represent the temporary variable
		symid - the symid of the temporary variable that is now in the symbol table.  
	push the new SAR onto the SAS

	what tests do I need to do to make sure A can be tested as less than B? 
		== and !=
			Must work for all datatypes
			A must be the same type as B

		< > <= >=
			only works for int and char types

			!!! DESIGN CHOICE !!!
			these guys can work if A is int and B is a char, or vice verse

	
What information (possibly from past semantic routines) do I need to do my job? 

What information do future semantic routines need to do their job?
