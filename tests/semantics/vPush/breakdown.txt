Who calls me? 
	class_member_declaration
	variable_declaration

What is my job? 
	Push a sar onto the SAS to indicate that a variable that was just declared exists. 

What information (possibly from past semantic routines) do I need to do my job? 
	I need to get the symid of the variable we just parsed in the symbol table. There should be a SAR with a symid in it only that I can pop off the stack.   
	
What information do future semantic routines need to do their job? 
	The SYMID of the variable i'm telling them exists. 

what Sars to I push?
