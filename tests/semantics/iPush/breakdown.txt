What is my job? 
	for each of the places where iPush can get called, we just pass in a token to iPush. Smoosh the token into a SAR and push the sar onto the SAS.  

What information (possibly from past semantic routines) do I need to do my job? 

What information do future semantic routines need to do their job? 

what Sars to I push?
