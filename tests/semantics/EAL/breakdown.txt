Who calls me?

What is my job? 
	OPTION 1 - Collect Symids (do this one for now)
		while SAS is not BAL, pop topSar off, extract the symid and put it into a list.  once we hit BAL, put list into a new arglist Sar and push onto SAS
	OPTION 2 - collect SARs
		 while SAS is not BAL, pop topSar off, put it into a list.  once we hit BAL, put list into a new arglist Sar and push onto SAS

What information (possibly from past semantic routines) do I need to do my job? 
	Evaluated epxpressions that are represented via iExist and rExist as symidSars (token, symid)

What information do future semantic routines need to do their job? 
	Will anything in the future ever need more than the token and symid? 

what Sars to I push? 
	arlistSAR (list of Symids)
