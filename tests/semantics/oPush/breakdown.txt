Who calls me? 
	field_declaration (assignment op path)
	variable_declaration (assignment op path)	
	statement (if path)
	statement (while path)
	statement (switch path)
	expression (parentheses open path)
	fn_arr_member (parentheses begin path)
	fn_arr_member (array begin path)
	expressionZ (for each type of operator)
	new_declaration (parentheses begin path)
	new_declaration (array begin path)


What is my job? 
	pass the operator token to oPush.  oPush will push the token onto the Operator stack. 

What information (possibly from past semantic routines) do I need to do my job? 
	just the operator token passed from the grammar rule. 

What information do future semantic routines need to do their job? 
	Any semantic action that evaluates operators will be popping this off the Operator stack.  

what Sars to I push?
	NONE
