What is my job? 
	pop two SARs off the SAS (B adn then A).  Test that B can be added to A.  Create a new symbol in the symbol table that represents the result of this operation.  Create a token that represents the temporary variable, Put symid and token into a new SAR and push that sar onto the SAS.  

	What tests do I do to make sure A can be added to B? 
		A and B sars need to have symids of symbols that have the type of int  

What information (possibly from past semantic routines) do I need to do my job?
	inside the two sars that I pop off the SAS, i need
		symid
		token - for the line number if a number happens 

What information do future semantic routines need to do their job? 
	symid - of new symbol we added to the symbol table representing the result of the operation.  

	token - a fake one that represents the tempVar.  
			lexeme = symid of tempVar in symbol table
			tokenType = TEMP
			lineNubmer = line number of the token that's inside the first sar we popped.  

what Sars to I push? 
	symid_sar (symid, token)
