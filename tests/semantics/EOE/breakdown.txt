Who calls me? 
	field_declaration
		non-method, no assignment, and yes assignment path. 
	variable_declaration
		after the semicolon
	statement
		expression path, after the semicolon

What is my job? 
	pop operators off the OS, pop top two SARs off SAS and test if the popped operation can be performed on two two top SARs. 

	What allows for two SARs to be operated on each other? 
		It depends on the operation.  

What information (possibly from past semantic routines) do I need to do my job? 
	Symids of the two top operands

	If I evaluate two top operands, I need to put the result of that back on the SAS because EOE might need it.  I'll need to to create a temporary variable in the Symbol Table, put the symid of that temp var in a SAR and place that sar on the stack 
		UNTIL we get a simple "x = y" like expression.  
		Then, we just make sure y can be assigned to x
	When there are no more operators on the stack, EOE's job is done.  

What information do future semantic routines need to do their job? 

what Sars to I push?
